# Pomodoro
This Python code creates a Pomodoro timer application with a graphical user interface using the Tkinter library. Here's a description of its key components and functionality:

1. **Constants:**
   - Various constants such as colors, fonts, and time intervals are defined at the beginning of the code.

2. **Sound:**
   - The `set_alarm` function uses the Pygame library to play an alarm sound ("Alarm.mp3") when a timer cycle completes.

3. **Timer Reset:**
   - The `reset` function stops the current timer, resets the countdown display to "00:00", and resets the label back to "Timer."

4. **Timer Mechanism:**
   - The `timer_mech` function manages the timer cycles (work, short break, long break).
   - It updates the timer label and calls the `count_down` function with the appropriate time duration based on the cycle's type.

5. **Countdown Mechanism:**
   - The `count_down` function handles the countdown display and logic.
   - It calculates and updates the time remaining in minutes and seconds format.
   - When the countdown reaches zero, it triggers the next timer cycle (work, short break, long break) and updates the tick marks to track completed work sessions.

6. **UI Setup:**
   - The code sets up the graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter.
   - It creates a window with the title "Pomodoro" and specified padding and background color.
   - A canvas displays a tomato image representing the timer, along with the countdown timer display.
   - Labels are used for the timer type and tick marks.
   - Buttons for starting and resetting the timer are also provided.

The Pomodoro timer follows the Pomodoro Technique, a time management method that involves work and break intervals to enhance productivity. Users can start and reset the timer using the provided buttons, and the application keeps track of completed work sessions with tick marks. When a timer cycle completes, an alarm sound is played to signal the end of the session.
